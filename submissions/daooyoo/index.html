                <h2>The Setup</h2>
                <p>
                    It gets tiresome being the odd one out. It's something you get used to when
                    all your cousins are girls and you're the only boy around. In the summer of 2003,
                    I took a trip to Korea with my sister and my mom. While we were there, all the women
                    in my family decided to go on a trip to Thailand. I was asked if I wanted to go, and I said no
                    becuase I didn't feel like being stuck with a bunch of women with no other male to keep
                    me company. However, they wouldn't take no for an answer; I was forced against my will.
                    So it came to be that I would journey to Thailand with my sister, my mom, 4 aunts, and 6 of my girl cousins.
