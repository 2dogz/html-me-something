<h2>1. R</h2>
<h3><em>Why R? Because all the data needs to be analyzed.</em></h3>

<p>R is a powerful statistical language.</p>

<h2>2. Python</h2>
<h3><em>Why Python? Because it's one of the hottest programming languages.</em></h3>

<p>Python is a very powerful programming language with many libraries relevant to bioinformatics, such as biopython.</p>

<h2>3. Perl</h2>
<h3><em>Why Perl? What biologists used to use. </em></h3>

<p>Perl has been really the go-to language for computer programming in bioinformatics. Though obsolete in several other languages, it is still widely used in bioinformatics, and it's certainly one of the go-to languages even today for bioinformatics/computational biology.</p>

<h2>4. Java</h2>
<h3><em>Why Java? It's powerful and what many call, "industry standard" for companies.</em></h3>

<p>Java shouldn't need an explanation; after all, it is a very powerful language that has been basis of many softwares, websites, and app developments (i.e. Android). Its application to bioinformatics/computational biology is that for many complex modeling and predictions, it makes sense to rely on something strong, such as Java or C.</p>

<h2>5. Go</h2>
<h3><em>Why Go? It's being embraced by Google, so it may become big in the future...</em></h3>

<p>Google's Go is a rather language in the recent list, but it is something in between Python and Java and other languages. It is memory efficient, and still has programming concepts absent in Python. Interestingly, it is actually the course that Carnegie Mellon's MS in Bioinformatics uses to teach people how to program.</p>
