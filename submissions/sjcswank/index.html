      <h4>Playing a video game is an experience.</h4>
      <p>The expansive worlds, immersive
        plot lines, nearly insurmountable odds, and heros we can all hope to
        see ourselves in. But- what ever happened to the everyday heros? The
        plumbers, the miners, and the cheese wheel heads?</p>

      <h4>Meet Jane Doe. </h4>
        <p>Jane and her wife have been married for just over a
        year (YAY!) and are ready to start a family. There's just one problem-
        their adoption aplications keep being denied. When a vile social worker
        admits that Mrs. and Mrs. Doe are being denied for being homosexual
        Jane vows to fight for her future and family.</p>
        <p>As you lead Jane through the labyrinth of local and federal
          legislation you must collect Votes to help you in your battles. Votes
          are hidden around each level- be sure to collect them all for special
          bonuses! You will have to navigate around obsitcles like dogs and
          crowds. Don't be afraid to climb buildings, jump onto awnings, and
          even run across rooftops.</p>
