      <p>Meet Jane Doe. Jane and her wife have been married for just over a
        year (YAY!) and are ready to start a family. There's just one problem-
        their adoption aplications keep being denied. When a vile social worker
        admits that Mrs. and Mrs. Doe are being denied for being homosexual
        Jane vows to fight for her future and family.</p>
        <p>As you lead Jane through the labyrinth of local and federal
          legislation you must collect Votes to help you in your battles. Votes
          are hidden around each level- be sure to collect them all for special
          bonuses! You will have to navigate around obsitcles like dogs and
          crowds. Don't be afraid to climb buildings, jump onto awnings, and
          even run across rooftops.</p>

        <p>Face off against some of the most viscious villians in the United
          States. Protesters, Politicians, even Supreme Court Judges will all
          try to stop you in your quest for Equality. You must not let them win!
          Use your weapons wisely. The Glove of Justice can help you knock some
          ethics into your opponents. The Empathy Ray will freeze enimies in
          their tracks, and the Knowledge Bombs are the most powerful weapon of
          all!</p>
          <p>Suceed in your quest and you will recieve THE ULTIMATE REWARD.
            We'll let you figure out what that is for yourself.
